#### Hello class, my name is Ryan, I am studying for my Computer science degree with a concentration in security.

#### I have an extreme passion for offensive blue teaming, and in specific finding and tracking crypto scammers and ruggers. If I could have life my way my job would be open to the DoD and I would be in charge of gathering a database of $eth, $btc, and $sol wallet addresses and parsing them for further analysis on fraud to track back to a wallet that has been through KYC verification, for example. I am also extremely passionate about keeping the capital INSIDE of the United States and to create a purple team that is designed to offensively and aggressively halt all money traffic/ scams into specific regions like Kolkata. The local police in India will never stop something that is financially benefiting them. Why America has no defense for the elderly as technology advances at such a violent rate is well beyond me. A lot of the older generation barely understand the basic functions of a computer and the Windows operating system.

#### The average temperature is 68.2°F. This number represents the typical temperature across all days.
The middle temperature is 71.0°F, which is the center value when all temperatures are arranged in order. The fact that this middle value is higher than the average shows that there are some days with lower temperatures that are pulling the overall average down.

####The spread of temperatures is quantified by a variance of 72.17, indicating that there's a range of temperatures around the average.
A standard deviation of 8.5°F signals that daily temperatures do fluctuate, but not too drastically. It's a measure of how much temperatures typically deviate from the average.

### Given that the average is lower than the middle value and considering the standard deviation, you can tell that the temperature data is slightly skewed to the left, meaning there are more days that are cooler than average.

#### The line plot displayed the general trend of daily maximum temperatures in my area. Line plots are effective for illustrating trends over time and can clearly show whether temperatures are rising or falling over the days observed.

#### Measures of central tendency, like the average and middle values, help identify the central point of a data distribution. They provide information about the typical location of data points. None the less, measures of variability, such as spread and standard deviation, tend to show how data points are distributed around this central point. Together, these measures offer a full view of the data distribution, including its center, range, and overall shape (no matter if it's concentrated or spread out, symmetrical or skewed).

#### The side-by-side boxplot visually compared the temperature distributions of my area and Zion. This type of graph is useful for examining the central tendency and variability between two datasets. In the boxplot, Zion shows a higher middle temperature and a broader range of temperatures, as seen by a wider interquartile range and the presence of outliers. This can help show that Zion's climate may be more variable compared to where I live.
