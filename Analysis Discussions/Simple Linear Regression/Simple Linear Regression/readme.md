# Simple Linear Regression Analysis

## In this weeks discussion, I created a scatter plot that illustrates the relationship between a car's weight and its fuel efficiency, measured in miles per gallon.

### The plot shows a clear downward trend, that as a car's weight increases, its mpg tends to decrease. This observation aligns with my expectation that heavier cars, requiring more power to move, are usually less fuel efficient than their lighter counterparts.

#### The correlation coefficient between mpg and weight is -0.869365, indicating a strong negative correlation. Therefore, there's a clear inverse relationship between these two variables that prove that as one goes up, the other tends to go down.

#### From this analysis, I derived a simple linear regression equation: mpg = 37.2825 − 5.3106 × weight<br><br>This formula allows a car rental company to predict a vehicle's fuel efficiency based on its weight. These types of predictions can be valuable for selecting cars for the fleet, estimating costs, and setting competitive rental prices that can accurately reflect the vehicles' fuel economy.<br><br>The regression equation's slope coefficient, -5.3106, tells us that for every additional 1,000 pounds a car weighs, its mpg is expected to decrease by about 5.3106. The t-statistic for this coefficient is -9.309, with an associated P-value that is well below the 0.05 threshold for significance at the 5% level. This indeed can be used to confirm that a car's weight significantly impacts its fuel efficiency.
