    "You are a data analyst for a basketball team and have access to a large set of historical data that you can use to analyze performance patterns. The coach of the team and your management have requested that you come up with regression models that predict the total number of wins for a team in the regular season based on key performance metrics. Although the data set is the same that you used in the previous projects, the data set used here has been aggregated to study the total number of wins in a regular season based on performance metrics shown in the table below. These regression models will help make key decisions to improve the performance of the team. You will use the Python programming language to perform the statistical analyses and then prepare a report of your findings to present for the teamâ€™s management. Since the managers are not data analysts, you will need to interpret your findings and describe their practical implications. \n",

    "The average relative skill (represented by the variable **avg_elo_n** in the data set) is simply the average of a team's relative skill in a regular season. Relative skill is measured using the ELO rating. This measure is inferred based on the final score of a game, the game location, and the outcome of the game relative to the probability of that outcome. The higher the number, the higher the relative skill of a team. \n",
